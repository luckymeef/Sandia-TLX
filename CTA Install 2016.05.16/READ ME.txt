Sandia TLX v.1.0  

---READ ME---

Glad you decided to use Sandia's Task Load Index (TLX) macro for Visio Professional. 
NOTE: This macro will only work if you are using the *Professional* version of MS Visio. 


---Install Instructions---

(NOTE: There is an "Install Walk Through" PDF with step-by-step images of the install process and where to click in the software zip file)
Print this page of instructions (there is a required PC "restart" step half way through that will close this file)
Download the files
Find the file folder titled "CTA Install 2016.05.16.zip" (this may be in your Downloads folder). 
Double click on CTA Install 2016.05.16.zip (Note: you may have to right-click on the file and select unzip)
Double click on "CTA Install 2016.05.16"
Double click on "CTA Installer.msi"
You will likely get a pop up saying, "Window's protected your PC..." 
Click on "More Info"
Click "Run Anyway"

After installing, re-start your computer. (Required for the macro to work)

Open Visio. 
Under the "New" tab, you will see two options "FEATURED" and "CATEGORIES", Click on "CATEGORIES".
Under "CATEGORIES", click on the folder icon called "SNL" (which stands for Sandia National Laboratories).
Click "CTA Template" (CTA stands for Cognitive Task Analysis)
Click "Create" and you will have a new blank project with special features (e.g., Quick Drop Shapes, TLX pane, SME ratings, Data Graphics, etc.) 


 

---Other Help---

If you have problems during install email Rob Kittinger, PhD at rskitti@sandia.gov; for potential modifications (adding features or capability) to the software email Rubi Gemmell at rubigemmell@interarchyiq.com; for all other help please use the Sandia TLX "HELP" button (question mark icon in a blue circle) in the upper right-hand corner of Visio once the software is loaded.
